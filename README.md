> # Tweeting plant project

In this project I have combined python and c++.
The main goal of this project was learning on how to use api's indifferent programming languages.
The API I used was "tweepy", it is a python wrapper for the twitter API.

> ## Instructions

In the folder twitter; open the twitterAPI.py code and replace **TOKEN** with your personal tokens.
Set up an arduino with a soil humidity sensor and if you want to, an LCD display. Make sure you use an Arduino Uno since that's what the Arduino program will compile to. After you set up the Arduino, check your pins to make sure you connected them to the right in- and outputs.

> ## Run

After everything is correctly set up; first run the Arduino code, then run the python code.
The program will now send a tweet telling you the humidity level of your plant every 15 minutes.
The tweet should be sent from the account you athenticated with your personal tokens.
